REST Controller

Following is one possible Rest based controller, implementing REST API. I said possible, means Otherâ€™s may implement it in another way, still (or even more pure way) conforming to REST style.

This is what our REST API does:

GET request to /api/user/ returns a list of users
GET request to /api/user/1 returns the user with ID 1
POST request to /api/user/ with a user object as JSON creates a new user
PUT request to /api/user/3 with a user object as JSON updates the user with ID 3
DELETE request to /api/user/4 deletes the user with ID 4
DELETE request to /api/user/ deletes all the users

Sample url :: http://localhost:8080/SpringBootRestApi//api/user/
